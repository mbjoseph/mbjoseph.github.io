Occupancy modeling is possible in Stan 
[as shown here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stan-users/ZuLmNl4Q9xc), 
despite the lack of support for integer parameters (without marginalization).
In many Bayesian applications of occupancy modeling, the true occupancy states 
(0 or 1) are directly modeled, but this can be avoided by marginalizing out the 
true occupancy state.
The Stan [manual](http://mc-stan.org/manual.html) (pg. 96) gives an example of 
this kind of marginalization for a discrete change-point model.

For a Stan implementation of a dynamic (multi-year) occupancy model
[@mackenzie2003estimating], see: https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/tree/master/BPA/Ch.13
