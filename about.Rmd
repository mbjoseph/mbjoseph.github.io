I am a data scientist at [Planet](https://www.planet.com/) working on forest carbon, formerly an academic. 

I develop probabilistic models with applications to forest carbon, ecology, natural hazards, extreme events, and global change. 
I also contribute to and develop a variety of open source software projects in Python and R, in the interest of fostering open, reproducible, and reliable science.
