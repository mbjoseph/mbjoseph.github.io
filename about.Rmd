I am a data scientist at Earth Lab, part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
I am also an open science architect with the North Central Climate Science Adaptation Science Center. 

I develop probabilistic models with applications to ecology, natural hazards, extreme events, and global change. 
I also contribute to and develop a variety of open source software projects in Python and R, in the interest of fostering open, reproducible, and reliable science.
